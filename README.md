#Ballerina-TagMe

software which notify you with sms, when you're tagged on twitter


Introduction:
Most of the twitter users will not be notified immediately when someone tagged him/her in a tweet.
They have to log into the twitter account or activate notification to mobile phone to see those tagged tweets. 
Anyhow they need Internet connection to read those tagged tweets.
People can receive the tweets as SMS when someone who is followed by him posts a tweet.
But currently there is no application available to receive the tweet when you were tagged on it.

With this 'Tag Me' app, now you can receive the message to your mobile immediately
when someone tagged you in a tweet.
You do not need any Internet connection to get this service, just the SMS facility to your mobile phone.

Design:
I have used the wso2/twitter package to connect the application with twitter API
and wso2/twilio package to connect it with twilio API.
